### Getting Started
See the provided example project (SFGraphics GUI) for information on basic usage and how to render model and texture data.

### Requirements
| Component | Minimum Required Version |
| ---     | ---------------------- |
| .NET | 4.0 |
| OpenGL / GLSL | 3.30 |
| OpenTK | 3.0 |

# Projects
## SFGraphics
Object oriented wrappers that take advantage of C# language features for OpenGL objects such as textures, shaders, buffers, etc. The wrapper classes provide a safer and simpler way of working with OpenGL objects.

Method and class names closely match the OpenGL specification in most cases. Wrapper classes expose the integer ID generated by OpenGL for when calling OpenGL functions directly is required.

## SFGraphics.Utils
Contains helpful methods for working with colors and vectors. Provides methods to facilitate working with `Bitmap` and `Color` objects in the `System.Drawing` namespace. Provides methods for generating tangent, bitangent, and normal vectors.

## SFGenericModel
Provides classes for rendering generic vertex data of a specified struct. The `GenericMesh<T>` class handles the management of buffers and vertex attributes internally. This class can be subclassed to allow for simplified rendering of vastly different vertex data.

## SFShapes - WIP
Uses the SFGenericModel classes to provide rendering of basic 3d geometric primitives.

## SFShaderLoader
Provides methods for simplifying shader loading from text and precompiled binary sources. Note that shader binaries require more modern versions of OpenGL.  

## SFGraphics GUI
An simple example of using the provided libraries in a WPF application to open and display Obj and Collada files using various debug rendering modes for vertex attributes.
