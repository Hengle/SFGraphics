# SFGraphics
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2u86186wtxiq77jw/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ScanMountGoat/sfgraphics/branch/master)  

**This library is still in early stages of development, so don't use this for any important projects until the first official release. Appveyor support is WIP.**

An OpenGL utility library using OpenTK. Classes in the GLObjects namespace provide object oriented
wrappers for OpenGL textures, shaders, buffers, etc. This makes changing state less error prone.
Most objects provide access to the integer ID generated by OpenGL, so more manual control of state
changes and memory is still an option if needed.

In addition, GLObjects can take advantage of .NET's garbage collection for managing memory. The
memory management approach has some limitations to keep in mind due to the nature of OpenGL,
however. See the online documentation for details.

Feel free to use this library for your projects but please make sure to provide an accessible link
to the source code and license for this repository.

# Issues
Please report all issues in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/SFGraphics/issues).  

# Building WIP
Support for platforms other than Windows not planned. There may be issues with the .NET target
framework not matching, but this can be changed before building.

Each commit to the master branch is built by Appveyor, which also runs the unit tests for
SFGraphicsTests.

# [Documentation](https://scanmountgoat.github.io/SFGraphics/)
Click the link above for online documentation generated by
[Sandcastle](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB). The online documentation is updated less
frequently than the doc comments. Configure the project to export the doc comments as an XML file
for access to comments when using the DLL in Visual Studio. The XML should be in the same directory
as the DLL.

### Smash Forge  
The vast majority of the code is adapted from the classes I originally wrote for Forge rendering.
This includes but is not limited to code for textures, shaders, vector conversion methods, etc.
